# PAMFPN
PAMFPN: Position Attention FPN for Object Detection of Remote Sensing

1. Please install the ultralytics code library, refer to the URL: https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics
2. You can choose two ways to use our code:
(1) Directly embed PAMFPN.py and conv.py into your method.
(2) If the ultralytics code library has been installed, you can embed nn into your local ultralytics code library (recommended because it contains the reproduction of the comparison method in the paper).
3. Others: The cfg folder contains the training configuration files (model and training parameters).
Finally, thank you very much for your patience in reading!
